## How to set up the environment & Run：
This project was developed and tested in Google Colab.  
All project files were stored in Google Drive. 


1. Downloading the dataset 

    Run the commant below to download the original video
    - if you want to download another version(Deepfake, or FaceSwap, and so on), simplyty change "original" to "Deepfake"

    ```
    # download 150 original videos with compression level c23.
     python3 datasetScript.py ./data -d original -c c23 -t videos -n 150 --server EU2           
    ```

2. Open `Project_CheckPoint1.ipynb` in Google Colab.
3. Mount your Google Drive in Colab:
4. Install the required packages:
    ```
    !pip install -r Requiment.txt
    ```
5. Make sure the dataset file, model file, and notebook are located in the correct paths. 
    ```
        In my notebook, It setup base on Google Colab, If you have all of the datset file, model store in local, then You could simplyly change the "deepfake_dir" , "original_dir", and "save_dir" to your local file address.
    ```

6. run all the cell!
